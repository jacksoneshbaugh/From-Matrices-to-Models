# From Matrices to Models
This repository is an appendix for a study I wrote for a linear algebra class at Lafayette College. You can find the paper [on my website](https://jacksoneshbaugh.github.io/projects/).

## Abstract
This paper investigates the mathematical foundation and application of linear algebra in artificial neural networks (ANNs), a widely used model in machine learning (ML). We begin by explaining the mathematical building blocks of ML algorithms, highlighting how their structure relies on linear algebra. The discussion then transitions from theory to practice by implementing an ANN to solve the XOR problem and running a prediction through manual calculations.

## About Me
I'm a computer science and French student at Lafayette College in Easton, PA. I am passionate about technology, language, and their intersection as well as bioinformatics, the intersection of computer science and biology. Ultimately, my goal is to become a professor of computer science and to focus my research on ways we can use computer science to improve other fields. For example, I am super interested in bioinformatics, the marrying of biology and computer science, a field that I believe will soon explode and change the world.
